## Overview
This C2 profile consists of HTTP requests from an agent to the C2 profile container, where messages are then forwarded to Mythic's API. The C2 Profile container acts as a proxy between agents and the Mythic server itself.

The Profile is not proxy aware by default - this is a component left as an exercise for the individual agents.

## Configuration Options
The profile reads a `config.json` file for a set of instances of `gin` webservers to stand up (`80` by default) and redirects the content.

```JSON
{
  "instances": [
  {
    "ServerHeaders": {
      "Server": "NetDNA-cache/2.2",
      "Cache-Control": "max-age=0, no-cache",
      "Pragma": "no-cache",
      "Connection": "keep-alive",
      "Content-Type": "application/javascript; charset=utf-8"
    },
    "port": 80,
    "key_path": "privkey.pem",
    "cert_path": "fullchain.pem",
    "debug": true,
    "use_ssl": false,
    "error_file_path": "",
    "error_status_code": 404,
    "payloads": {}
    }
  ]
}
```

You can specify the headers that the profile will set on Server responses. 
If there's an error, the server will return a `error_status_code` message based on the `error_file_path` file contents in `C2_Profiles/HTTP/c2_code`.

If you want to use SSL within this container specifically, then you can put your key and cert in the `C2_Profiles/HTTP/c2_code` folder and update the `key_path` and `cert_path` variables to have the `names` of those files. 
Alternatively, if you specify `use_ssl` as true and you don't have any certs already placed on disk, then the profile will automatically generate some self-signed certs for you to use.
You should get a notification when the server starts with information about the configuration:

```
Messages will disappear when this dialog is closed.
Received Message:
Started with pid: 16...
Output: Opening config and starting instances...
Debugging statements are enabled. This gives more context, but might be a performance hit
not using SSL for port 80
[2020-07-29 21:48:26 +0000] [16] [INFO] Goin' Fast @ http://0.0.0.0:80
```

A note about debugging:
- With `debug` set to `true`, you'll be able to `view stdout/stderr` from within the UI for the container, but it's not recommended to always have this on (especially if you start using something like SOCKS). There can be a lot of traffic and a lot of debugging information captured here which can be both a performance and memory bottleneck depending on your environment and operational timelines.
- It's recommended to have it on initially to help troubleshoot payload connectivity and configuration issues, but then to set it to `false` for actual operations

### Profile Options
#### crypto type
Indicate if you want to use no crypto (i.e. plaintext) or if you want to use Mythic's aes256_hmac. Using no crypto is really helpful for agent development so that it's easier to see messages and get started faster, but for actual operations you should leave the default to aes256_hmac.

#### Callback Host
The URL for the redirector or Mythic server. This must include the protocol to use (e.g. `http://` or `https://`)

#### Callback Interval
A number to indicate how many seconds the agent should wait in between tasking requests.

#### Callback Jitter
Percentage of jitter effect for callback interval.

#### Callback Port
Number to specify the port number to callback to. This is split out since you don't _have_ to connect to the normal port (i.e. you could connect to http on port 8080). 

#### Headers
This is an array of headers you want to include in your agent for HTTP comms. By default, this includes a standard User-Agent value and an option to add in a Host header for domain fronting. You can then add in as many other custom headers as you want.

#### Kill Date
Date for the agent to automatically exit, typically the after an assessment is finished.

#### Perform Key Exchange
T or F for if you want to perform a key exchange with the Mythic Server. When this is true, the agent uses the key specified by the base64 32Byte key to send an initial message to the Mythic server with a newly generated RSA public key. If this is set to `F`, then the agent tries to just use the base64 of the key as a static AES key for encryption. If that key is also blanked out, then the requests will all be in plaintext.

#### Get Request URI
The URI to use when performing a get request such as `index`. A leading `/` is used automatically to separate this value from the end of the callback host value.

#### Name of the endpoint before the query string
This is the query parameter name used in Get requests. For example, if this is `q` and the get request URI is `index`, then a request might look like `http://domain.com/index?q=someback64here`.

#### Proxy Host
If you need to manually specify a proxy endpoint, do that here. This follows the same format as the callback host.

#### Proxy Password
If you need to authenticate to the proxy endpoint, specify the password here.

#### Proxy Username
If you need to authenticate to the proxy endpoint, specify the username here.

#### Proxy Port
If you need to manually specify a proxy endpoint, this is where you specify the associated port number.

## OPSEC

This profile doesn't do any randomization of network components outside of allowing operators to specify internals/jitter. Every GET request for tasking will be the same. This is important to take into consideration for profiling/beaconing analytics.
